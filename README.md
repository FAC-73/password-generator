## Project deliverables

#### Included functionality
The generate button is used to trigger the series of prompts requiring the user to provide parameters for their password as follows:

1. Provide a value between 8 - 128 for your password string length. If the user inputs an invalid value they'll go into a loop until a valid value is input.

<br>

![Password Generator prompt invalid](https://github.com/FAC-73/password-generator/blob/main/Assets/Images/invalidLength.png?raw=true "Password Generator prompt invalid")
<br>

2. If the user wishes to exit the dialog after invoking the action they can do so using the cancel action and returned back to the main view.

<br>

3. Once they have provided a valid string length value, sequential confirmation dialogs include additional paramenters for generating the password. Each parameter is optional. Parameters include options for numbers, special characters, upper and lowercase letters.

<br>

4. If the user does not confirm at least one parameter from the four options the user is looped and an alert is shown asking them to choose at least one parameter.

![Include at least one parameter](https://github.com/FAC-73/password-generator/blob/main/Assets/Images/invalidCriteria.png?raw=true "Include at least one parameter")
<br>

5. Once the user chooses a parameter the selections are stored as a variable and concatenated with the array of letters, numbers and characters determined by the user in the confirm dialogs.

6. A password is then randomly generated using a for loop using the values stored in the passwordCreate variable and the the math.random function. The stringLength variable provides the length of the password to be generated as specified by the user.

7. Once the password is successfully created and populated into the textarea HTML element using a function.

<br>

8. The password can be copied to clipboard using the 'copy to clipboard' action. This uses an eventListener for the button click, and and execCommand to copy the string, once copied the text changes to green using setAtrribute.
